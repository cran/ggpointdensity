\title{Count Neighbors within a Radius}
\usage{
count_neighbors(x, y, r2, xy)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of x-coordinates of the points.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of y-coordinates of the points.}

\item{r2}{A numeric value representing the squared radius within which to
search for neighboring points.}

\item{xy}{A numeric value representing the aspect ratio (usually the ratio of
the y-scale to the x-scale).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector where each element represents the count of
neighboring points within the specified radius for each point.
}
\description{
This function counts the number of neighboring points within a specified
radius for each point in a given set of coordinates using a C implementation.
